<h1 align="center">Hi There! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Preeti Agrawal</h1>

I am a Full stack developer with a passion for creating modern and dynamic web applications in cloud environment.

My studies and project experiences have given me exposure to modern web development where I built several front-end projects in React.Js, Typescript, CSS3 and back-end Rest APIs in Python, Node.js, Spring-boot.

I have hands-on experience with ElasticSearch, Ruby-on-rails, Django as well.

I have containerised both front-end and back-end applications and deployed them in docker environment e.g. AWS ECS Fargate, docker-compose.

I have hands-on experience with many services in AWS used for serving web applications, including writing AWS infrastructure as a code using CDK.

I also created Python/shell scripts to automate the deployment which is also used by CI/CD pipelines e.g. Github actions.
